# Python Teaches Typing

Tired of fancy graphics in your typing tutor? Well, look no further, for you
have found Python Teaches Typing!

This is a console/ascii based typing tutor inspired by Mario Teaches Typing.

But this is even *more* retro.

Because it's just the terminal.


To play, download `pytt.py` and run it:

    $ python pytt.py

Should run under Python 2.7+ and 3.X, but only tested on Python 3.4 and Linux.

If you're willing to test this on other platforms, please do so and let me know
in the issues how it went!
